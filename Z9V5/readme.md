## [Z9V5-MK2](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Z9/tree/main/Z9V5-MK2)
#### **Z9V5-MK2 mainly improves than Z9V5-MK1**:  
1. **Hot end interface** When shipping, the print head (hotend assembly) is separated from the backplane. There are 5 connectors behind the backplane, which can connect the wiring of the hot end without opening the control box. It will help switch between [**different types of hotends**](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Upgrade-kit-guide/tree/main/HOTEND) quickly.    
2. Improved the M4 hotend from the 2nd version (***M4-V2***) to the 3rd version(***M4-V3***). More details of the M4 hotend, please refer to [Here](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Upgrade-kit-guide/tree/main/HOTEND/M4%20%204-IN-1-OUT%20Mixing%20Color%20Hotend).  
3. Improved the backlight of ZONESTAR LOGO.  
4. Improved the cover case of control box to make it easier to open.  
5. improved the belt transmission device to prevent the belt from scratching the idler pulley.  
6. improved the filament run out installation to make it solve the problem that may lead to the winding of filament. 
#### NOTE
Due to the shortage of chips, a small numbers of **Z9V5-MK2** used **ZM3E4V1** control board. Please check the product serial number (a white lable pasted on the power supply). If the product with serial number **V1xxxxxxxx** , it means your machine used a **ZM3E4V1** control board. Basically ZM3E4V1 has the same features with ZM3E4V2.      

## [Z9V5-MK3](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Z9/tree/main/Z9V5-MK3)  
#### **Z9V5-MK3 mainly improves than Z9V5-MK2**:  
1. Upgraded bed leveling sensor to [**ZLSensor**](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005002865311470.html), to replace the PL-08N bed leveling sensor. ZLSensor can probing the glass directly.  
2. Upgraded the extruder motor drivers to [**TMC2225**](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003270721219.html)(from A4988). So **Z9V5-MK3**'s firmware is different with **Z9V5-MK1** and **Z9V5-MK2**.  
3. Improved the [**M4 hotend**](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005001581641783.html) from the 3rd version (**M4-V3**) to the 4th version(**M4-V4**). More details of the M4 hotend, please refer to [**Here**](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Upgrade-kit-guide/tree/main/HOTEND/M4%20%204-IN-1-OUT%20Mixing%20Color%20Hotend).
