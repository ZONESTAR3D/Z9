## Assembly
### 1. Install Z profiles
#### Install 4 Z Profiles to the bottom assembly. Note that there is a hole on one of side of Z profile, this side should be toward to the upper. There is a hole next to the rubber foot pad of the bottom assembly, which is used to fix the Z-axis profile. Mount M5x22 screws from the bottom profiles upwards and secure to Z profile.

### 3. Install top assembly
#### Place the top assembly (the side with motors on the back) on the Z-axis profiles, note that the screw cap of the Z carriers should be placed in the groove of the profile of top assembly. Two sides are fixed to the sheet metal of the Z carriers by using M4x36 long screws, use 4 PCS M5x22 screw to fix the top assembly and the Z-axis profiles, and use other 4 PCS M5x22 screws to fix the side of the Z profiles and the Y-axis profiles.
### :warning: Don't tighten these screws in this step.
