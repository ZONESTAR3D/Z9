# Z9V5 upgrade kit / parts
## Laser engine
By upgrading this item, you can turn your 3D printer into a simple laser engraving machine. Higher power laser modules can improve engraving speed or support materials with higher melting point.

## WiFi
By upgrading this item, you can remote control your 3d printer.

## Direct drive extruder
By upgrading this project, you can print flexible materials (such as TPU filament). Of course, it also has other advantages and disadvantages of the "direct drive" extruders, such as having less strings issue, better flow, more supporting materials, etc., Also because of the heavier weight of the extruder, the printing speed must be lower.

## Hotends
Each type of hot end has its advantages and disadvantages, you can choose different hotends according to different requirement:    
- **High-speed and high-temperature Hotend (single color)**: It can support higher  printing speed and higher temperature consumables (up to 300 degrees when using stainless steel nozzles), and can be used to print PVC and PC.  
- **3-IN-3-OUT Hotend**: It can support printing different typs of filaments in one 3d prints, such as PLA+PVA.  
- **3-IN-2-OUT Hotend**: It can be regarded as a combination of 2-IN-1-OUT and a single-color hot end, which can simultaneously achieve the needs of color mixing and printing of different materials.    
We will launch more hot ends in the future, so stay tuned. If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to let us know at any time.
