## :warning:NOTICE:warning:
### :loudspeaker:If you are a beginner of 3d printer, please carefully read the [:book: Step-by-Step Guide](./step_by_step.md), and following the steps to do step by step.  
### :loudspeaker: If you are experienced on 3d printer, please also briefly read the [:book: Step-by-Step Guide](./step_by_step.md) at least, and ensure that you have known how to load filaments to the hot end correctlly.
### :loudspeaker: You need to load all the 4 filaments to the hotend whether printing one or multi color 3d prints, incorrect operationa may block the mix color hotend. If the hot end blockage caused by incorrect operation, it is not covered by the warranty. For how to load filaments, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Z9/tree/main/Z9V5/Z9V5-MK5/1.Installation_and_User_Guide/readme.md#load-filaments)

## 3. Test Gcode
### :pencil: What Is G-code In 3D Printing?
G-code is information, or instructions that 3d printer requires in order to print a 3 dimensional object, it is the langurage of the 3d printer can understand. G Code is generated by your slicing software, by translating a standard 3D modelling file such as an STL file into the code that your specific 3D printer will understand.    
:page_with_curl: [**Reference 1**](https://beginner3dprinting.com/what-is-g-code-in-3d-printing/)  :page_with_curl: [**Reference 2**](https://www.reprap.org/wiki/G-code)     
### :book: Test gcode file list
**[:arrow_down: Download all test gcode files](./2.Test_gcode/Test_gcode.zip)**
- **xyz_cube.gcode**: A simple test gcode file for verifing if the machine is working well.  
- **TempCal_PLA.gcode**: A test gcode file to check the best printing temperature of your PLA filament.

## 4. Slicing
### :pencil: What is slicing In 3D Printing?  
Slicing software converts the 3d model file into G codes that the 3D printer can understand. These G-codes are a type of instruction on how the printer needs to print your design.:page_with_curl: [**Reference 1**](https://loveandrobots.com/what-is-slicing-in-3d-printing/)  :page_with_curl: [**Reference 2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slicer_(3D_printing))     
### Slicing software use guide
Please download the slicing software and install to your PC, and then read the guide or video tutorial to study how to slicing.

## 5. Firmware
### :pencil: What is firmware bin file and source code?
**Firmware bin file** is the exact memory that is written to the embedded flash.     
**Firmware source code** is the core part of the firmware. The entire firmware can be thought of as different sub modules. It is divided into many sub files. These files are called source files. And, the entire program files are called source file or source code. Now our firmware source code is base on [**marlin**](https://www.marlinfw.org).

## 6. Troubleshootings
- **[:arrow_right: Z9V5 Troubleshooting](./6.FAQ/readme.md)**

## 7. Others
- **Filament holder [:arrow_down:](./7.Others/FilamentSpoolBracket_90mm.zip)**. The filament holder of Z9V5Pro can support the vast majority of filament spool in the market, but there are also some filament spools that may be longer. You can download stl files and print them to replace the original ones.     
- **Power supply fan cover [:arrow_down:](./7.Others/PSUfancover.zip)**. The fan of the power supply may have some dust after long-term use. You can print a cover and install it on the power fan, which can be easier to clean. And this cover can also reduce the noise of the fan.    
- **Hotend fan duct [:arrow_down:](./7.Others/fan_duct_m4_v4.zip)**. The dock of the extruder fan is may be damaged after using a while, yiou can download and print one to replace it.     
- **Filament recycling box [:arrow_down:](./7.Others/Recyclebin.zip)**. When printing, there are always some fine threads that need to be removed. It is a good idea to print a small garbage box and install it on the Z-axis profile of the machine to collect this garbage.     
- **Tool station [:arrow_down:](./7.Others/Z9_tool_supports.zip)**. Diagonal pliers, tweezers, shovels, and small screwdrivers are commonly used tools with 3D printers. You can print a collection station for tools to place them.     
- **Filament run out detector case [:arrow_down:](./7.Others/FRODV6.zip)**. The case of the Filament run our sensor equipped with the machine is a print part. If it is damaged, you can print one by yourself.

## Advanced features
### Bed auto leveling
The platform of a 3D printer cannot be completely flat, when you are printing a large size 3d prints, you need to use the bed auto leveling feature to correct the curvature of the print platform.
- **[:book: User Guide](./1.Installation_and_User_Guide/Advances_Feature/Bed_Auto_Leveling)**    
- **[:movie_camera: Video tutorial](https://youtu.be/Zoyl6PybsUk)**   
### Power auto shutdown after print finished
Usually 3D printing takes a long time, you can enable this feature to let the machine turn off automatically after the printing is finished to save energy.    
**[:movie_camera: Video tutorial](https://youtu.be/SJLpmJL-tG4)**     
### Filament run out detect    
If there is not enough filaments left in the filament roll to complete the current printing, you can enable the ***"run out detect"*** feature. The machine will pause the printing when detected the filament is run out, then you can load a new filament roll and resume the printing. What you need to do is:    
1. Pass the filament through the **Filament Run Out Sensor**.
2. Turn on the **run out** feature on LCD screen.      
**[:movie_camera: Video tutorial](https://youtu.be/QCJ-6L6ze1w)**   
#### :warning: Notice
1. If you're sure that the filament is enough, do not pass the filament through the **Filament Run Out Sensor**.         
2. The printing pause may cause some obvious defects on the prints.   
### Power losss recovery
If your power supply network has frequent power outages, you can enable the automatic power losss recovery function before start printing. When the power goes out and it resumed, you can press the DC switch to turn on the power of the machine, and then the machine will automatically detect the printing breakpoint and provide you with whether you need to continue printing.      
[:movie_camera: **Video tutorial**](https://youtu.be/f-PpasByiiE)    
#### :warning: Notice 
1. Breakpoints data and gcode files will be stored on the SD, must keep the SD card in socket before turn on the machine.       
2. The printing pause may cause some obvious defects on the prints.
