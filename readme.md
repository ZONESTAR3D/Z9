# About Z9 series 3d printer
**Z9M2** launched in 2018, it is the first verison of Z9 series. it has produced two versions, Z9 and Z9S. Z9 use a H-BOT structure and Z9S used a Core-XY structure, and after Z9S, all of the Z9 series are used Core-XY structure, the main features of Z9 include:  
1. Used **Aluminum profile frame** structure makes the machine  stronger and more stable. The profiles screw is directly fixed, which is more accurate than using profile connectors.  
2. Used **core-XY** drive structure effectively reduces the weight of the motion system.
3. Used **open builds pulley + V-profile track**. It has the comprehensive characteristics of high precision, high speed, low resistance and low cost.  
4. **Dule drive z-axis** design is adopted to simplify leveling and improve the stability of the printing platform.  
5. **Elastic replaceable hotend** design is adopted. Fast heat exchange end (extruder) can be selected according to different printing material requirements. The optional hot end includes:  
- **2-IN-1-OUT** mixing color hotend    
- **2-IN-2-OUT** hotend   
- **3-IN-1-OUT** mixing color hotend  
- **3-IN-2-OUT** hotend  
- **3-IN-3-OUT** hotend  
- **4-IN-1-OUT** mixing color hotend  
- **4-IN-1-OUT** non-mixing color hotend    
- **Direct drive extruder**  
- **High speed and large flow hotend**

# Z9V5
**Z9V5** is the latest version of Z9 series. Compared with **Z9M4**, the main upgrades include:
1. Higher pre assembly ratio and faster installation
2. The appearance is more beautiful
3. Using TMC silent motor drive module, the operation noise is lower (less than 55db @ 1 meter distance)
4. Upgrade to dual Z driver
5. **Z5V5Pro** is equipped with 4.3 "TFT-LCD display as standard
6. **Z5V5Pro** is equipped with glass hotbed

## Z9V5(-MK1) 
**The different between Z9V5 and Z9V5Pro is that:**    
1. **Z9V5** used 128x64 dots LCD screen (LCD12864) and a PC hotbed film.  
2. **Z9V5Pro** used used a 4.3" TFT-LCD screen (LCD-DWIN) and glass print platform  

## Z9V5-MK2 
**The different between Z9V5-MK2 and Z9V5-MK1 is that:**    
1. **Z9V5-MK2** mainly improves the hot end interface. When shipping, the print head (hotend) is separated from the backplane. There are 5 connecotor behind the backplane, which can connect the wiring of the hot end without opening the control box.  
2. Due to the shortage of chips, a small numbers of **Z9V5-MK2** used **ZM3E4V1** control board. Please check the product serial number (a white lable pasted on the power supply). If the product with serial number **V1xxxxxxxx** , it means your machine used a **ZM3E4V1** control board.  

## Z9V5-MK3 
**The different between Z9V5-MK3 and Z9V5-MK2 is that:**  
1. **Z9V5-MK3** improved bed leveling sensor to ZLSensor, to replace the PL-08N bed leveling sensor. ZLSensor can probing the glass directly.  
2. **Z9V5-MK3** improved the extruder motor drivers to TMC2225(from A4988). So the firmware of **Z9V5-MK3**'s firmware is different with **Z9V5(-MK1)** and **Z9V5-MK2**.
